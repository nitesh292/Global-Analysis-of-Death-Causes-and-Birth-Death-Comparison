# Global Analysis of Causes of Death and Birth-Death Trends

This Power BI project provides an in-depth analysis of global death causes and the relationship between deaths and births over time. The project visualizes trends, compares causes of death.

The primary aim of this project is to analyze global mortality trends, identify major causes of death, and examine the relationship between deaths and births across regions and over time.

## Overview

### Objective
This project aims to analyze:
1. The top causes of death worldwide.
2. Trends in births and deaths over time.
3. Geographical distribution of deaths by location.
4. Comparisons of causes of death across years and countries.

### Key Visualizations
   - **Total Deaths**: 15 billion.
   - **Total Births**: 28 billion.
   - **Average increase in Death rate : 0.85%
   - **Average increase inBirth Rates : -0.05%
   - **Top 10 Causes of Death**: A breakdown by sum of deaths (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms).
   - **Trends in Deaths and Births**: Line chart showing trends from 1990 to 2020.
   - **Worldwide Deaths by Location**: Map visualization of deaths across regions.
   - **Single Cause comarision between different countries: Line chart to show differences
   - **Cause of death by country: Bar chart to demeostrate the difference between motality rate in single country 
   - Filter-based analysis of specific causes of death (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases).
   - Trends in deaths caused by selected health conditions over time.

## Insights

### Key Findings
In 2019, approximately 548 million deaths were reported globally, attributed to various causes. Key insights from the data visualization dashboards include:

#### Leading Causes of Death:
- **Cardiovascular Diseases**: The leading cause of mortality worldwide, about 187 million in 2019.
- **Neoplasms (Cancers)**: A significant and growing contributor to global deaths.
- **Chronic Respiratory Diseases**: Another major cause of death with a consistent upward trend.

#### Regional Observations:
- Countries with higher population densities experience a proportionally greater number of deaths.
- Developing nations have shown a decline in deaths from diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other infectious diseases.

#### Trend Analysis:
- While some diseases like HIV/AIDS and malaria have seen a decline in mortality rates, especially in developing countries, non-communicable diseases like heart diseases, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases exhibit a positive growth trend over time, indicating an increasing global burden.

### Additional Observations
1. **Trends**:
   - Births and deaths increased significantly from 1990 to 2015, with a decline in deaths post-2015.
   
2. **Geographical Insights**:
   - Deaths are heavily concentrated in regions with high population density.
   - Patterns of specific causes vary significantly by region.

#### Death Rate
The global death rate has been increasing by approximately **0.85% per year**. The main reasons include population growth and increased rates of chronic diseases and lifestyle-related health conditions.

#### Birth Rate
The global birth rate is decreasing at a rate of approximately **0.05% per year**. This decline can be attributed to several factors:
1. **Socioeconomic Development**:
   - Improved education, particularly for women, has led to increased awareness and control over reproductive health.
   - Higher participation of women in the workforce has resulted in delayed childbirth and fewer children per family.
2. **Urbanization**:
   - Urban lifestyles and living costs discourage larger families compared to rural areas.
3. **Access to Healthcare and Contraception**:
   - Widespread availability of contraception and family planning services has empowered individuals to make informed reproductive choices.

## Improvements Possible

1. **Data Expansion**:
   - Include aging-related deaths (currently excluded).
   - Add more granular data (e.g., gender and age breakdown).

2. **Dynamic Reporting**:
   - Enable real-time updates using live data sources.
